This project was created primarily with the intention of learning more about MIDI (a protocol that 'describes' music, allowing computers and musical instruments to communicate).


Further improvements can be made by expanding the notation features, including moles/flats, triplets etc. <br />
Also, the playback functionality is created through the C# class WindowsMediaPlayer. Although very easy to use, events are not always fired properly. This often leaves the application hanging.
Currently, there is no MIDI to WAVE converter for Windows 10 (Timidity++ is only available for Linux). Might be a future project.

Stack/techniques used: WPF, C#, Python, Prism, MIDI.
